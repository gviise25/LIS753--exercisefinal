<h2> Reasons the Yankees took number 1 </h2>
<ul>
  <li>My grandparents are from New York and I go see a game every year with my grandpa, dad, and younger brother</li>
  <li>As I said, I played for our village T-ball Yankees for 3 seasons..maybe 1 season too long but it was some of the most memorable years of my life in sports.
    Is the reason I am such a big fan of the sport today </li>
  <li>My mom was always a Yankees fan, and she knew all of the players so I started becoming more familiar with them</li>
  <li>My uncle gave me my first ever autographed baseball memorbilia , and all of them were signatures of Yankees players. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Reasons the Twins took number 2 </h2>
  <ul>
  <li> My dad spent much of his childhood in  Iowa, so my dad grew up being a Twins fan</li>
  <li>We went to our first Twins game this year, and we absolutely love their new stadium( not quite as good as Yankees stadium though) </li>
  <li>There stadium is super family friendly, and they  always really seem to  have more of a fans first approach </li>
  <li></li>

<h2>The Chicago Whitesox </h2>
<ul>
  <li>They generally try to keep ticket prices as low as possible for families with ticket packages </li>
  <li>The Whitesox moved up my list becuase they have actually gotten better over the past 2-3 seasons. </li>
  <li> I did a Whitesox skills camp for a couple of years </li>
  <li> Their mascot Southpaw is cool and chill  asl. </li>
</ul>
