<h2> Reasons the Yankees took number 1 </h2>
<ul>
  <li>My grandparents are from New York and I go see a game every year with my grandpa, dad, and younger brother</li>
  <li>As I said, I played for our village T-ball Yankees for 3 seasons..maybe 1 season too long but it was some of the most memorable years of my life in sports.
    Is the reason I am such a big fan of the sport today </li>
