New York Yankees
Analysis

The 2019 New York Yankees finished just one home run shy of the Twins, and they actually finished ahead of them with a 118 OPS+ and (by a hair) 5.82 runs per game.

Edwin Encarnacion and Didi Gregorius have since left the Yankees, but healthy versions of Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton can account for that all on their own. The two sluggers are capable of turning back the clock to 2017, when they would have combined for a 1.028 OPS and 111 homers as teammates.

Gleyber Torres and Gary Sanchez give the Yankees two more candidates for 30-to-40 home runs in 2020. DJ LeMahieu and Brett Gardner could at least make a run at 30 long balls after hitting 26 and 28, respectively, last season. The former also hit .327 with a huge pile of hard-hit balls.

As back-end trios go, the Yankees could do far worse than Luke Voit, Gio Urshela and Mike Tauchman, who collectively had an .866 OPS and 55 home runs last year.


Chicago White Sox
Analysis

In 2019, the Chicago White Sox's offense more or less survived on the production of four hitters.

Yoan Moncada and Tim Anderson did most of the heavy lifting by combining for a .325 average, 43 homers and 27 steals. Jose Abreu and Eloy Jimenez, meanwhile, kept the power coming with 64 total long balls.

Now, the White Sox have Yasmani Grandal, who's slugged 101 homers as an everyday catcher since 2016. There's also Edwin Encarnacion, the only hitter who's annually topped 30 home runs since 2012.

That adds up to six well-above-average hitters out of nine slots in Chicago's lineup, and we haven't even gotten to its upside yet. Moncada, Anderson, Jimenez and Nomar Mazara fall under that umbrella, but not as much as Luis Robert. The rookie is coming off a 1.001 OPS, 32 homers and 36 steals in the minors.



Astros
Analysis

The Houston Astros may have scored "only" 5.7 runs per game last year, but they led the majors in batting average, on-base percentage and slugging percentage and could generally do no wrong offensively.

For instance, they had both the lowest strikeout rate and the highest walk rate, and they also finished third with 288 home runs. And despite conspiracy theories about illegal buzzers, the league's investigation into the Astros' sign-stealing scandal found no evidence of any wrongdoing during their '19 campaign.

All the players who made Houston's offense go last season are back once again for 2020, and it's possible that 2019 doesn't even represent their peak performance. Carlos Correa, for example, has proved he has MVP-caliber upside if only he could stay healthy.

This could also be the year that former top prospect Kyle Tucker finally breaks through. If his .946 OPS, 58 homers and 50 steals over the last two seasons at Triple-A are any indication, he can be an all-around offensive superstar.
